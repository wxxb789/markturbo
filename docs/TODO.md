# TODO

## Deferred

- [ ] **Downloadable macOS arm64 app** — Build a `.app`, sign it with an Apple
  Developer ID, notarize and staple it, publish the artifact, and verify a
  downloaded copy launches from Finder on a clean Mac. Requires Apple Developer
  Program credentials and a macOS signing environment. Diagnose the reported
  non-running binary separately; a new package does not explain its failure.
- [ ] **静默 A/B** — Re-run the `opt-level = 3` versus `opt-level = "s"`
  startup and first-formula comparisons after
  `uv run --project scripts scripts/mt.py probe -- quiet --wait-seconds 3600`
  passes. Keep the current
  decision not to adopt `s` until the quiet-machine measurements are complete.
  See [ticket 05](../.scratch/perf-and-size/issues/05-opt-level-s.md).
